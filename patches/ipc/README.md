### Description
Largely based on [raphi](https://sr.ht/~raphi/)'s [somebar](https://sr.ht/~raphi/somebar/), this patch provides an ipc for wayland clients to get and set dwl state. The ipc is intended for status bars, but can also be scripted with tools like [dwlmsg](https://codeberg.org/notchoc/dwlmsg).

Status information to stdout is currently disabled as dwl tends to freeze. For now, `dwlmsg -w` should act as a drop-in replacement.
